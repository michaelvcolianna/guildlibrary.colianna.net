She met another smuggling group, [Don't Touch That](/category/spaceships/dont-touch-that), co-captained by another couple experiencing infertility. After learning the coordinates of [Gaia](/category/planets-cities/gaia) from [Tunde Brower](/category/character/tunde), Mary visited and learned some shocking news: Gaia is *Earth*, making its people humans like she'd originally feared. This knowledge helped her finally convince the overly cautious [Cooperators](/category/organizations/cooperators) to take action, though, and she returned to the [Three Empires](/category/organizations/three-empires) with enough good Gaians to recover the oppressed planets.\r\n\r\nFor their next IVF attempt, three eggs fertilized and developed properly. Davi and Mary opted to transfer two against the advice of their doctor. This resulted in twins, but toward the end of her first trimester, one's heart stopped. The remaining one was healthy, however, and they realized they'd have to learn to live with that.\r\n\r\nMary looks similar to Radhika Madan, with freckles under her eyes.
