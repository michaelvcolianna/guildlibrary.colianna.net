Hzga is a member of the [Integration](/category/organizations/integrators). She appears to have been a [Cooperator](/category/organizations/cooperators), but after some time spent observing humans she changed her mind.

Though Hzga is not physically described in the book, she looks similar to Sheila Carrasco.
