    - { title: 'Gaians (Visitors)', content: "A race of people from [Gaia](/category/planets-cities/gaia). They arrived on [Tessyas](/category/planets-cities/tessyas), claiming to be from the [Three Empires](/category/organizations/three-empires). They were supposedly in the process of re-integrating the people of Tessyas with the rest of humanity. However, during his visit home, [Davi](/category/characters/davi) learned they left the planet entirely around 4,088 A.D.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be physiologically the same as humans, but have learned to harness their [dielsis](/category/tech-futurism/dielsis) lobes to read and control the minds of other beings. This ability does not appear to be uniform, and it is suspected that some cannot use it at all while others are very powerful. As a result, their plan to colonize humanity is being carried out by infiltrating the governments of the Three Empires and corroding them from the inside.\r\n\r\nPeople who wear pins with red backgrounds and golden sunbursts are known to either be Gaians or working with them/under their influence.\r\n\r\n**Known Gaians/supporters:**\r\n- [Doctor Svakino](/category/characters/doctor-svakino) (wears a red pin)\r\n- [Jacquan Koliss](/category/characters/jacquan-koliss) (also known as Jm ir:Kwy, a Gaian, deceased)\r\n- [Birthwort](/category/characters/birthwort) (likely human, but under Gaian control)\r\n- [Kudzu](/category/characters/kudzu) (likely human, but under Gaian control)\r\n- [Rosh Telencia](/category/characters/rosh-telencia) (wears a red pin, is suspected to be a Gaian due to his participation in the smuggling portion of the takeover plan)\r\n- [Kto ti:Mbr](/category/characters/mubarr) (deceased)\r\n- [Md vm:Gnml](/category/characters/ganmel)\r\n- [Slka la:Gv](/category/characters/sylka)\r\n- [Hzga uu:Nks](/category/characters/hzga)\r\n- [Bluebell/Kemba Tiran](/category/characters/bluebell) (also known as Kmba wo:Trn, a Gaian, deceased)\r\n- [Marte Puccar](/category/characters/marte) (doesn't wear a pin, but is suspected of being Gaian after a private investigator couldn't find anything out about him)", excerpt: 'A race of people from Gaia.
