Due to the inability of the [Three Empires](/category/organizations/three-empires) to unite and get along, the smuggling profession became very useful and profitable. Around the time that the [Great Wars](/category/culture-history/great-wars) ended, several smuggling groups got together and formed the Cartel as a means to lend some level of organization and legitimization to the practice. While smuggling is still illegal, the Cartel's ranks provide cheaper goods to the various planets.
