Merrick is a security officer on the [Vinillense](/category/spaceships/vinillense). He was born in 4,047 A.D. (51 years old) on [Arrikara](/category/planets-cities/arrikara).

Merrick is married to [Gareth](/category/characters/gareth), and [Yuri](/category/characters/yuri) is their daughter.

Merrick looks similar to Dallas Goldtooth, with greying brown hair. His left eye is a biomechanical prosthetic. He is a little over 2 meters tall, and an average weight for that height.
