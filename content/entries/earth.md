At some point in the past, scientists discovered an anomaly in the Earth's sun which was burning through its fuel at a much faster rate than normal. As a result, the star would begin expanding and possibly turn into a super nova in a drastically close time (within one-thousand years).

The citizens of Earth built [three ships](/category/culture-history/three-ships) and left the planet, but by the time they settled the [Three Empires](/category/organizations/three-empires) and developed technology to get back faster, the sun had already expanded and destroyed the planet.
