Captain of the [Farsight](/category/spaceships/farsight). He does not appear in the story, and is only mentioned. The captain's first name is Gamban.

Though Captain Nwotik is not described in the story, from [Mary's](/category/characters/mary) memories, he looks similar to Mpho Koaho.

**Pronunciation:**
- gam’ ben
- na~woe’ tick (tilde means run the syllables together)
