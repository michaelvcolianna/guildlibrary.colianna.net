As [Orue](/category/tech-futurism/orue)-based travel expanded the limits of speed, humans inevitably ran up against a barrier: They could get close to the speed of light but never match or exceed it. This was due both to the limits of construction materials and those associated with the human body. In trying to find the solution, a scientist eventually discovered that the light they could not surpass could be utilized.

Using the immense inertia provided by Orue, ships were able to refract the light some distance ahead of them. Since that light was traveling a little faster than they were, when the beam's light bent, it compressed all the space between. Ships could then travel across that compressed space, shortening their trip. More powerful ships could do this over greater distances and maps planning the journeys out came to be known as accordions, due to the zig-zag lines.
