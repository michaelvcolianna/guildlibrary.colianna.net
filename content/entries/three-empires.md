After humans [left](/category/culture-history/three-ships) [Earth](/category/culture-history/earth), three planets were settled first: [Cratton](/category/planets-cities/cratton), [Gastel](/category/planets-cities/gastel), and [Velopa](/category/planets-cities/velopa). As it took some time for the planets to develop faster space travel, all three developed their own empire. Each of these planets has several other planets that are part of its empire.
