Also known as the Gibraltar campion, the silene tomentosa is a relic of [Earth](/category/culture-history/earth). The flower has no known habitat in the universe, and the only place to see a preserved specimen is at a museum on [Ur-Magad](/category/planets-cities/ur-magad).

[Captain Nwotik](/category/characters/nwotik), [Mary's](/category/characters/mary) captain from the [Farsight](/category/spaceships/farsight), claims to have delivered one once.
