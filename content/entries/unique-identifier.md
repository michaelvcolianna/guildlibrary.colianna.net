When a space ship's engines are assembled, the controlling computer for them utilizes the identification codes of their hardware to generate a cryptographically unique identification code of its own. This code allows for some level of tracking for an individual ship, since engine failure is unlikely and it's a great cost to replace any number of them to disrupt this code.
