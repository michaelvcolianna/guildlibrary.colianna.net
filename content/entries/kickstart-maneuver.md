[Mary's](/category/characters/mary) signature piloting move, which she discovered by accident when she was first learning how to fly a spaceship. By creating clashing gravity fields with the [Gravitic](/category/tech-futurism/gravitics) engines, she is able to ramp the [Orue](/category/tech-futurism/orue) engines to full blast during the apogee of both fields. Once the two fields resolve, the Orue kicks in and is already at full power (often, above legal limits).
