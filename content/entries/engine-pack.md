The term used to describe the configuration of engines in a space ship. Each ship has some number of [Orue](/category/tech-futurism/orue) and some number of [Gravitic](/category/tech-futurism/gravitics) engines â€“ usually 2:1. So a ship with four Orue and two Gravitic would be called a four/two pack.
