In addition to [bolts](/category/tech-futurism/bolts), some weapons were developed that utilized a stunning effect. This technology was placed into pistols, riles, and ship-mounted cannons. An obtundation gun, despite its name, usually knocks a target fully unconscious. Early versions merely reduced someone to a lethargic state, hence the name.
