With the development of [bolts](/category/tech-futurism/bolts), militaries and police needed protection. Blast armor was developed to either deflect bolts or be the material they burrowed into and shredded. Older blast armor from the [Great Wars](/category/culture-history/great-wars) can withstand actual explosions, and some troops from those days possessed entire suits.
