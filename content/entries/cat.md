    - { title: 'Cat (Catyrina Ristian)', content: "Catyrina was [Davi's](/category/characters/davi) sister. She lived on [Tessyas](/category/planets-cities/tessyas) with her father, [Kymball](/category/characters/kymball), and her step-mother, [Dalya](/category/characters/dalya). She was born in 4,061 A.D. on Tessyas. It is unknown what her occupation was, but she became obsessed with a conspiracy theory about the [Visitors](/category/organizations/visitors). Cat believed that the Visitors were really a race of people from the planet [Gaia](/category/planets-cities/gaia), and who sought to take over humanity. She spent her life chasing this conspiracy even though nobody believed her – not even her own parents. She does not appear in the story, but Davi reads her notes and remembers her often.\r\n\r\nAt some point, Cat figured out how to use the Gaian [dielsis](/category/tech-futurism/dielsis) powers, but her experiments in doing so backfired. She blacked out and killed a man during the period of time she can't account for. Guilt from the unintentional murder was too much for Cat to handle and she took her own life as a result.\r\n\r\nCat died in 4,084 A.D. (23 years old) after drowning herself in [Levastia](/category/planets-cities/levastia).\r\n\r\nTo the best of Davi's memory, Cat looked similar to Rissa Kilar. She was an average height and was skinny.\r\n\r\n**Pronunciation:**\r\n- cah tee ree’ nuh\r\n- riss’ tee en", excerpt: "Catyrina was Davi's sister.
