As a result of the increasing speeds granted by [Orue](/category/tech-futurism/orue), humans needed to compensate for some unwanted effects on passengers. Gravitic dampers grew more and more complex to account for the speeds, to the point where a computer could effectively make near-light travel more comfortable than on-planet airplane trips.

Another challenge humanity eventually solved with Gravitics was attaining gravity without the use of magnetic boots. Space ship design grew more spherical over time so that rails could spin around the ship. Over time, an internal "sustainer" was created so that the role of the rails could be purely focused on travel. With Gravitic travel, ships could be piloted through solar systems, to and from planets, without any need for a gas or metal fuel.
