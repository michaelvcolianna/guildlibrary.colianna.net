Bolts are small projectiles shot from firearms. The majority of weapons are pistols, but there are rifles and implements capable of rapid-fire. Bolts are designed to embed into someone's skin and, within a short period of time, eject little pins and spin them around, shredding a person's insides. They are supposed to be used as a method of suppression for violent crimes, since the bolts fired by police at a violent subject can be deactivated if the subject cooperates.

Modern bolts are an innovation of older technology from the [Great Wars](/category/culture-history/great-wars). During those older times, bolts either burrowed into a surface then exploded after a set time in order to disperse a crowd, or shot out smaller bolts to inflict shrapnel damage to a violent crowd.
