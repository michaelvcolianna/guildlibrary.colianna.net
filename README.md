# The Guild Library Appendix

A mutable appendix for my stories. This was a learning project for me, to showcase I could learn a good chunk of Next quickly AND that I know TypeScript. If anyone stumbles across this and has suggestions for better ways to do things, send 'em over! I try to search for best practices when I'm making something like this, and love to see what could be done differently. (Ex: I know I could probably use the Context API for my global state instead of leaning on local storage so heavily.)

## Info 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to retrieve local Markdown files that I manage with a custom [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) backend that utilizes [Orbit](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/orbit). Styling is [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
