# The Guild Library Appendix

A mutable appendix for my stories. Deploys to a Vercel domain because I didn't feel like doing all the config to have my main site hosted on Netlify and this hosted on Vercel as a subdomain. This is a work-in-progress. The site may or may not load at certain times, depending on what I'm doing, and it may or may not be styled/functional.

## Info

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to retrieve local Markdown files that I manage with a custom [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) backend that utilizes [Orbit](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/orbit).
