    - { title: null, content: "The hajar was a double-reed woodwind instrument, noted for sounding like a chordophone. The hajar is also noted for having only one known physical production, which has since been destroyed, and was only ever played twice by two different people. One of those performances was in an untitled symphony.\r\n\r\nThe hajar was invented by [Gaians](/category/organizations/visitors). Only a few were ever produced, mainly in the VM sector. After the Gaians were defeated, some lingering [Integrators](/category/organizations/integrators) burned the remaining models.\r\n\r\n[Marte Puccar](/category/characters/marte) brought a hajar with him when he fled [Gaia](/category/planets-cities/gaia), using the instrument to become a famous musician among the [Three Empires](/category/organizations/three-empires).\r\n\r\nPuccar passed the instrument along to his son, Vichere, who learned how to play and performed one time in a symphony. When Vichere exited the venue, he tripped and fell down a tall flight of stairs. The fall killed him, and he landed on the instrument, destroying it.\r\n\r\n**Pronunciation:**\r\n- huh jar’" }
