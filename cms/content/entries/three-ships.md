After the discovery of the anomaly in [Earth's](/category/culture-history/earth) sun, the world government set about building ships to take generations of people to [Cratton](/category/planets-cities/cratton), [Gastel](/category/planets-cities/gastel), and [Velopa](/category/planets-cities/velopa). This even is sometimes referred to as, "leaving the planet."
