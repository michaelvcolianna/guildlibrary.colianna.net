Pickle is the pet cat of the [Vinillense](/category/spaceships/vinillense). She was born in 4,095 A.D. (3 years old) on [Ekayko](/category/planets-cities/ekayko). She was brought aboard the ship by [Boka](/category/characters/boka), but all of the crew love her.

Pickle has blue-grey fur and green eyes (she is a Russian Blue, though the crew isn't aware that's the breed name).
