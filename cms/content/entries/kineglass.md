A glass-like metal alloy. Kineglass was born out of attempts to "block" the uncountable number of particles that hit ships traveling through space at the high speeds attained with [Orue](/category/tech-futurism/orue). Though it inevitably failed at that job, Kineglass turned out to be an excellent way to install large windows on ships and create the amazing ceilings of the underground cities on [Lairia](/category/planets-cities/lairia).

The word is a combination of kinetic and glass.

**Pronunciation:**
- kihâ€™ neh glass
