A magnetic net can be fired by any number of space ships. Usually, they are installed on military and law enforcement ships, but can be found elsewhere. The nets lock one more more ships together and are often used as a somewhat passive means of encouraging cooperation.

In situations with a hostile space ship, though, multiple vehicles can fire a net to ensnare someone who is fleeing or firing weapons.
