A group of people from [Earth](/category/culture-history/earth) who launched their own space ship, independent from the [Three Empires](/category/organizations/three-empires), and settled [Tessyas](/category/planets-cities/tessyas). Their leader, [Frederick Bolen](/category/characters/frederick-bolen), told them that they had committed an atrocity against humanity requiring atonement, and that they would be isolated until such time as everyone forgave them. This reasoning was used to enforce strict laws on Tessyas.
