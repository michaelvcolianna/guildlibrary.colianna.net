A piece of equipment used by military and law enforcement to pull doors off of vehicles. The doorbuster has a drill tip that bores through most metal. Once it is through, it extends some powerful gripping hooks that clamp against the door, then expels a huge burst of accelerant to pull away from the vehicle, taking the door with it.
