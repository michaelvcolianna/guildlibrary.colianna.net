Orue is a metal discovered on [Velopa](/category/planets-cities/velopa) with the power and density of bismuth-209, but lacking that element's diamagnetism. Orue allowed humans to reach speeds up to four times faster than older technology from its onset. As time wore on, the speed climbed until humans were able to achieve near-light travel. It was at this point that [refraction](/category/tech-futurism/oref) was discovered.

Some challenges that humanity overcame as a result of Orue's implementation:

- Kinetic energy of the interstellar medium and its destructive effects on all known shipbuilding materials.
- The physical and psychological effects of intense acceleration and deceleration on human passengers.
- Engine dynamics for C-adjacent travel versus more "normal" speeds.

As a result of these (and other) challenges, humans developed technologies like [Gravitics](/category/tech-futurism/gravitics) and [Kineglass](/category/tech-futurism/kineglass).
