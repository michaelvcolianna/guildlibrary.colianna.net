    - { title: null, content: "Throughout her various notebooks about the [Gaian](/category/organizations/visitors) conspiracy, [Cat](/category/characters/cat) mentions that [Kto ti:Mbr](/category/characters/mubarr) manipulated her in a way she refers to as \"placing a block\" on her. While it is unclear what kind of tampering it was, the act seems to have gotten Kto ti:Mbr reassigned from [Tessyas](/category/planets-cities/tessyas) to [186](/category/mysteries/186). Cat believed that the block caused her some speaking difficulties, which was a source of external ridicule and internal distress. She also believed the block was placed because of her potential to use [dielsis](/category/tech-futurism/dielsis).\r\n\r\nAfter Davi killed [Md vm:Gnml](/category/characters/ganmel) he questioned why the most power dielsis user ever never attempted to manipulate him â€“ especially since his blocking device was broken. A brain scan revealed that Davi's dielsis lobe was, for lack of a better term, destroyed. They questioned [Slka la:Gv](/category/character/sylka), which jogged her memory: She recalled that Gnml ordered her to kill Mbr after a failed attempt to alter the Ristian boy. To test the truth of that statement, Davi brought Slka to a remote location and removed the blocking circlet.\r\n\r\nSlka confirmed that Davi's damaged dielsis lobe left him immune to the power. It likely also explained his bizarre reaction to [obtundation](/category/tech-futurism/obtundation). So, while Cat believed the block had been placed on her, it appears that Davi was the recipient." }
